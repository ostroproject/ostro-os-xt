# This feature was already removed from KERNEL_FEATURES_INTEL_COMMON
# in meta-intel master (a4c1cfb53d192, linux-yocto*: remove mei from
# KERNEL_FEATURES) and continuing to use it breaks the build because
# the yocto-kernel-cache specified above no longer has the feature.
#
# But we are on an older meta-intel revision and updating would have
# to be done with some care because of a gstreamer-vaapi change
# (3f51f61efe9, "care should be taken to keep the gstreamer-vaapi build
# configuration in sync with the gstreamer build configuration"). That
# change has to wait, so for now just apply the same removal here:

# remove them directly here because otherwise the new upstream code
# won't compile.
